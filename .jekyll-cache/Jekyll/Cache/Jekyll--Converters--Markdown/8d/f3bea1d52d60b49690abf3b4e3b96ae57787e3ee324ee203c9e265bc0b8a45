I"÷<p>Done in Photoshop for a Newgrounds contest. The theme was â€œpartyâ€</p>

<p>Process:
I did a few thumbnails before in my sketchbook, so I had a general idea of what I wanted to do beforehand. Then I solved most of the compositional and anatomy problems in the sketch stage</p>

<p>Inking was fun. Not too interesting. It was here that I added all the textures. The fence was a pain, but the brick wall wasnâ€™t too bad</p>

<p>Then colored the characters in. I also solved the lighting in this stage, and decided that it would probably be better for it to be nighttime, and have the only light source from the candles. This way the focal point would be clear.</p>

<p>Then lastly I colored in the background and figured out what was going to be on the left. I had some ideas in the sketch phase, but they didnâ€™t go so well, so I just opted for a simpler background. Hereâ€™s the flat coloring:</p>
